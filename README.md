# The Mole Deobfuscation (ish)
Mole is a game played with one key, however the source code is lost to time.  
This is an attempt to make some of the compiled code more readable and potentially allow for modifications and other things.  

You can find the offical itch link [here](https://mmatt-ugh.itch.io/mole), and all of this is done with the permission from the developer.
